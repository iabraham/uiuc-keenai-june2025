# README 

**Question:** Can ChatGPT help debug intermediate level C++ code? 

### Provided files 

In the `correct` folder are files that create a Binary Search Tree for
arbitrary data types as long as the implement the comparison and ostream
operators. Given might not be the most performant implementation but it gets
the job done and there are no memory leaks. 

In the `prompt` folder are the same files with a few lines in the header file
modifed to introduce a few errors that prevent compilation and some that are
logical errors. 

### Student task 

The intention is to let students debug and figure out the errors in the files
with AI help. AI will typically give a bunch of suggestions which may not all
be correct.
